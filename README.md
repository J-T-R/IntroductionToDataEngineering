### Things you'll need

  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)  
  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Friendly Reminders  
  
This isn't production code, it needs things like decent tests and to actually scale. The code here is as examples to teach ideas, productionisation is not the goal. I'm doing all of this on Debian via WSL2.
