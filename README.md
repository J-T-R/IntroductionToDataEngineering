# IntroductionToDataEngineering  
  
A storage location for code associated with my medium ramblings on the topic:

### Things you'll need

  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)  
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)  
  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Friendly Reminders  
  
This isn't production code, it needs things like decent tests and to actually scale. The code here is as examples to teach ideas, productionisation is not the goal. I'm doing all of this on Debian via WSL2.  
  
Each of the sub directories is supposed to be standalone, so where we build on ideas from previous parts of the introduction there will be duplicated code.
